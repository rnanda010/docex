Final Decision
✅ Option 2 is the plan

Trial SB refresh starts Feb 28

Trial SB connects to EQ1

EQ2 is NOT used for the core 3.1 / 3.2 testing path right now

Converted data stays in EQ2, but EQ2 is treated as optional/secondary, not the primary execution path

Leadership preference voiced: Option 2 (Jamie explicitly preferred it) because it protects 3.1 UAT window.

Why EQ2 Was Rejected (for now)

EQ2 refresh for conversion is expected around April (week of Apr 6–13) and must happen before UAT, not mid-cycle.

Switching primary testing to EQ2 introduces additional operational risk and schedule risk (rewires, hiccups, timing dependencies).

Team consensus: don’t complicate, stick with what’s proven (EQ1 refresh from PROD).

What Gets Refreshed and When
A) 3.1 UAT protection

3.1 UAT runs through Feb 27

No refresh activity that disrupts EQ1 should happen before UAT completes.

B) SAP refresh (EQ1)

Start night of Feb 27 / early Feb 28

Take PROD snapshot (do not add converted data)

BASIS refresh into EQ1

Expected SAP refresh duration: ~2 days

C) Post-refresh data movement (SAP → Salesforce via MuleSoft)

Once SAP EQ1 refresh is ready:

SAP provides files

MuleSoft loads into Salesforce

Mule load duration: ~2–3 days

Net downtime/impact window described: ~3 days (mostly Mar 2–4)

Target “ready for resumed testing” date: March 5

Salesforce Trial SB Plan

Trial SB is refreshed starting Feb 28 (24 hours to clean copy of production).

Salesforce teams can prep PRs in parallel (no SAP dependency for preparing PRs/reviews).

Hard dependency: actual data sync/load must wait until:

Fields & Permissions PR (3.1) is deployed AND

SAP refresh provides files

Key Dependency Rules (as agreed)
✅ Hard dependencies

MuleSoft load depends on Salesforce Fields & Permissions PR (3.1) being deployed.

Data sync/load depends on SAP refresh files.

✅ Non-dependencies / parallel work allowed

PR review cycles, build readiness, deployment prep can proceed without SAP.

Many 3.2 SIT activities can continue where not blocked by refreshed SAP data.

Impacts Called Out
1) 3.2 SIT impact

You will lose ~3 days due to the SAP refresh + load cycle.

SIT1 already slipped (was supposed to start Feb 9 / earlier referenced), so this makes acceleration necessary.

2) Business tester impact

Business teams lose minimal “active testing time” if refresh happens over weekend,
but in-progress test scenarios and data will reset → needs a clear cutoff and comms.

Risk Decisions / Risk Mitigation
Risks accepted with Option 2

Short-term testing disruption (~3 days)

Additional delay pressure on 3.2 SIT

Mitigations explicitly requested

Comms plan (John coordinating with Susie / Monica)

Test acceleration + defect remediation acceleration plan for 3.2

Rohit to provide a clean project-plan-style timeline with dates + risks

EQ2 “Secondary Path” Outcome

Even though EQ2 is not the primary path:

Team wants MuleSoft capability to connect to BOTH EQ1 and EQ2 if feasible

EQ1 = refreshed PROD-like data for core testing/execution

EQ2 = converted data (useful later / ORT / IR4 discussions)

But reiteration: No change to current decision (still EQ1 primary).

Final One-Liner Summary

Option 2 wins: Protect 3.1 UAT through Feb 27, refresh EQ1 from PROD starting Feb 28, run MuleSoft reload Mar 2–4, and resume testing around Mar 5—while keeping EQ2 as a secondary converted-data environment and (ideally) maintaining connectivity to both.

If you want, paste this into a leadership email, and I’ll rewrite it into a crisp “Decision + Why + Dates + Actions/Owners” format.
